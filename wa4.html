  <h3> **GOT Spoilers** </h3>
<p>I found that when watching Game of Thrones through for the first time, I was in awe in how unpredictable and how simply crazy and exiciting the show was. The unpredicability seemed to be the key part where characters who were just introduced into the story who you grow a connection too often die from some sort of conflict in the storyline of the show.
</p>
<p>Game of Thrones does a job at creating connections with characters and then suddenly cutting them out of the storyline by death. Moreover the show tended to have the most amount of conflict via battles with the most important houses and characters. First off Jeffery Lancaster on github made a bar graph showing all of the characters durations on the show. Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targeryen, Sansa Stark, and Cerci Lannister have the most screen time out of all the characters on the show. This does make sense as each of these characters make it to pretty much the last episode. Moreover I found this quite intersting in relation to the screntime based on each season.
</p>
<p>In the first season it is mostly background for the Stark family, where Eddard Stark is the star of the show, he has significantly more screentime than the other characters by about a hour more, which I think plays a large part in our love for Eddard however he is killed off at the end of the seasons. Interestingly, Jon snow, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and Cersei Lannister all are in the top 6 of screentime in season 1, which I geuss was a little hint at the final season contendors. Moreover in season 2, Tyrion Lannister is the most filmed character followed by Arya and Daenerys. Then in season 3 Tyrion, Daenerys Targeryen, Jaime Lannister, Robb Stark are the big 4 in screen time, which I guess was a good way to throw off the audience with some really interesting action, however killing off Robb Stark who was the spotlight of season 2 and 3. Season 4 it is all Lannisters in the top 4 followed by Jon snow, which I geuss just simply showed off the power of the Lannisters, making the north seem hopeless. Then from season 5 and on it is pretty just Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Cersei Lannister and Daenerys that have the most screen time. I thought this was a really cool pattern to make a show off of, as the first couple of seasons so many good hearted characters are killed out of no where, which then allows the true stars of the show to rise, where you are just hoping they are not killed off before the end of the show.
</p>

Looking further into the character screentime it is quite interesting in the graph that Jeffrey Lancaster made of screen time per each gender for each season. What we can see from this is how dominated the time is by males. Just from looking at it I can see that easily more than half of the screentime is made up of all male or mostly male, with less than half of the total time equal to even time, more female, and all female. In relation to the character screentime most of the seasons top 5 screentime actors are 3/5 male for the most part. I further found this super intruguing as the two main characters in season 8 the finale are Daenerys Targaryen and Cersei Lannister, both who are women. To answer this I think that honestly this has to do with all the males with alot of screentime ending up getting killed off in the storyline, making the lesser expected characters to emerge as leaders as they develop. In addition to this I think this could have just been somewhat a timely thing, where back in the day since this show is somewhat based around battles and war, so it just ended up being mostly male characters.
</p>
<p>All in all, This show definately uses some patterns to help create suprises and simply deception to the audience in what is going to happen and what characters are important to the long term story. It deceives the audience by creating false connections with some characters, while also making the big characters to war with each other, which in turn usually ends with one side losing and dying off. Also the screentime is dominated by males for the whole duration of the show, yet interestingly the two who battle in the final season are both females. Moreover as we can see from the graph I produced from python, We can see that most of the battles occur at the beginning to middle of the show with the most amount of soldiers involved, which then leads up to a big finale battle as we can see.</p>
