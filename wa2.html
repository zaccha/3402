<h1 style="color:green">This is my Weekly Assignment #2 short essay<h1>

<p>As a robinhood user myself, I found the whole WallStreetBets page on reddit really quite funny and interesting as it is something that is completely new to the public as well as. Robinhood made a big mistake in my opinion in how they dealt with the overwhelming amount of people investing in GME or Gamestop. What they did was restrict how much gamestock stock you could purchase at the time, in order to stabilize the market. However In my opinion they should have let the spike happen with the GME stock and then it would even out naturally as these hotstock riders would eventually pull out as the investment is not sustainable. As a data Scientist one might say, I think this whole topic is super interesting as someone who could ultimately analyze the whole situation using the Python skills I have learned at CU.
	Going off of this as a data scientist me or any of my peers could have created a Python program that looked at what were the topics with the most frequency and upvotes on WallStreetBets on Reddit in order to see where the trends were at in guidance of investment. By having a program like this we could have been on the start of the GME craze as we would have seen the buzz starting, as well as the number of users who supported the idea. Data analysts should now, since the event already happened, look at the types of people investing, common traits, when in the timeline of announcements and online posts did people invest after, to see the impact, this could allow the researcher to be on the upper end of those who benefit from these internet crazes.
	The whole overall idea of this event with Gamestop just shows how fast data and how useful the data on the internet is. People who were following Elon Musk when he tweeted Gamestonks were essentially given straight up investing advice where the average person who knows nothing about investing or stocks could have bought GME stocks and then sold the next day once the peak ended, it was that simple. I do not think that social media platforms should have any say in how these things happen, as the internet should be a free place where people can interact without any interruption or censorship.
	In terms of the responsibilities that the platforms have over the users, I think actually that the users should be the ones responsible and in charge of their exposure and interactions online. People should be doing their research and know what they are getting themselves into when they do things on the internet. This ultimately allows the internet to grow as we can allow more and more types of interactions and transactions on the internet, which I think is more important that a users ignorance. If a senator were to argue that there needs to be regulations, I would argue that having unrestricted interactions, allows opportunity for more people who have some sort of intelligence as its up to them whether they benefit, worsen their situation, or choose to not get involved. I would say that there should be some sort of security protocol for the companies stock by the company that prevents their stock from fluctuating too much, but this can be done by having a high purchase threshold in order for the company to deter users from jumping in and out of their stock like the GME hotstock situation.</p>
