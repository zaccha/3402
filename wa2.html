<p>As a robinhood user myself, I found the whole WallStreetBets page on reddit really quite funny and interesting as it is something that is completely new to the public as well as. Robinhood made a big mistake in my opinion in how they dealt with the overwhelming amount of people investing in GME or Gamestop. What they did was restrict how much gamestock stock you could purchase at the time, in order to stabilize the market. However In my opinion they should have let the spike happen with the GME stock and then it would even out naturally as these hotstock riders would eventually pull out as the investment is not sustainable. As a data Scientist one might say, I think this whole topic is super interesting as someone who could ultimately analyze the whole situation using the Python skills I have learned at CU.
	Going off of this as a data scientist me or any of my peers could have created a Python program that looked at what were the topics with the most frequency and upvotes on WallStreetBets on Reddit in order to see where the trends were at in guidance of investment. By having a program like this we could have been on the start of the GME craze as we would have seen the buzz starting, as well as the number of users who supported the idea. Data analysts should now, since the event already happened, look at the types of people investing, common traits, when in the timeline of announcements and online posts did people invest after, to see the impact, this could allow the researcher to be on the upper end of those who benefit from these internet crazes.
