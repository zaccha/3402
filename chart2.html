	<h3> Version #2</h3>
<p>Blind Skier Product First glance rating</p>
<p>What I changed for version 2 is the label for the graph, as well as sizing and window size formatting for the graph. In addition I changed the labels for the graph to better represent what the data is about which is not colors, but rather about the rating of the product. In addition I removed the cross lines that distracted from the graph the the y axis which was irrelevant.</p>
<!-- the scaling of the axes, the sizes of the fonts, any missing legends, etc.
As with website design, you might want to do a little bit of research online to get ideas on how to improve your plot.
There are many (Links to an external site.) resources (Links to an external site.) teaching how to make nice-looking plots online.
You must include a second version of your chart under a section called version 2. 
You must explain how you improved your chart following version 1. -->
