<h1>Weekly Assignment #14</h1>

	<p><b>RevealJS, </b>For one I think that the revealJS slides are super useful in a teaching aspect of HTML. Having the knowledge of how to use revealJS to have mapped slides with colorblocked codeblocks are super helpful and easy and useful for someone who is looking for a step by step explaination in how to do a certain HTML function. Moreover it is going to be super helpful for presentations down the road as using a coded website is much more professinal and effortful than simply using a google slides presentation. This would be a very good application in a very business and professional setting where I can show off my coding skills subtily while also being able to provide self made visualizations and graphs that can show off my technical skills.</p>
<br>
	<p><b>Jupiter Notebook, </b>Another one could be using Jupyter notebook and showing a data scientist my analysis in heatmapping covid results for example. Python shows alot of core coding skills as it is much more technical than HTML coding so that it shows a sort of indepedance with coding. Moreover being able to show a data scientist my heatmap really does show efficiency. This is true because Heatmapping is a great way at showing a population spread and certain hotspots within a region. Being able to code a heatmap from most datasets or API's really does tell the full story in whats happening as well as really giving the viewer a very strong understanding. It shows technical understandings of the material as well as a strong understanding of data manipulation and data visualization. This further can show my technical coding skills, and show my back-end skill and work that goes into the visualizations I create. Also can allow me to show off the small tweaks and modifications that can help portray different things in my visualziations.</p>
<br>
<p>
	<b>HTML, </b>Another way that we have gone very indepth in this class is a simply website. Having a very well built, clean, and clear website allows a very clear transfer of knowledge as well a very strong presentation of a project or portfolio for example. Having a website with clear navigation can present a ton of information very effectively. Being able to use the skills in our class to make picture grid boxes as well as using bootstrap to jazz up all our buttons and animations. Having the knowledge in how to do this, gives us the skills to beable to take up web design jobs as well as the intuition in how to learn coding skills that we do not currently know which I think is a super strong skill. This would be a more useful application for those not looking for a super technical hire. Rather they are looking for more visual and the design aspects which I think we have learned a great bit about in this class!</p>
<br>
<p>
	<b>Bootstrap, </b>Bootstrap was a super helpful tool that we learned in our class that really ups the presentation and professionalism of our HTML that we are coding. Bootstrap simply touches up alot of the visual features that are on our website making it look a ton more modern and not so Early 2000's esc. Moreover for a e-commerse website or any sort of porfolio type of website for myself, Bootstrap really makes the website alot more pleasant and easy to work with. I think I will mostly be using bootstrap for touching up websites as well as helping out if I were to get a web design/web development website.</p>
<br>
<p>
	<b>Vega, </b>Vega has been crazy helpful in kind of making sense of everything we have learned in the duration of the INFO science major. it incorperates our python visualization skills with our HTML presentation skills to combine and really create very nice/interactive/and ultimately useful graphs that we can present on our websites. Knowing how to use vega will be very helpful in showing data analysis whether it be using heatmaps, linegraphs, or bargraphs being the ones we mostly used. Knowing how to present real live data and just making sense of datasets by manipulation will be extremely helpful in lots of job applications in showing how we know and can use a simple data set.</p>
