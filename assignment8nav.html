<h2>Step #3</h2>
<p>I found my findings quite interesting, it shows that vehicular stops are almost twice as common as a pedestrian stop. I am geussing that this is the case as people are in the most harm towards others in vehicles vs just on foot, so they must take precautions more with vehicles. That seems to be the only plausible explaination to me. Another reason, although im not sure how plausable it is, is maybe the amount of laws you can break while driving vs walking, therefore by nature, driving has higher stoppages? Another could be that being drunk while driving is much easier to indicate than a pedestrian walking around drunk? Moreover I would like to see further in how maybe certain city's layouts with cars and crosswalks may correlate with police stoppages and such. Maybe towns with more confusing street layouts have higher arrest rates, due to the weirdness of the streets and layouts, that would be really interesting at looking at.</p>
